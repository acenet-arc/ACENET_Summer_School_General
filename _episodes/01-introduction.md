The ACENET Parallel Programming Summer School will focus on teaching students the basics of parallel programming. This will include lessons in shared memory programming (through OpenMP), message passing parallel programming (through MPI) and GPGPU programming (through CUDA).

The intention is to teach these topics in an intensive, hands-on, format to try and cover the essentials of each technique. The hands-on sections will hopefully provide tangible experiences to anchor the ideas in your memory.

Each afternoon will be devoted to working on larger problems. Ideally, you will have brought problems from your own research area to work on, with assistance from the instructors.
