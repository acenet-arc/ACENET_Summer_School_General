## What does that mean in terms of our MD algorithm?

### Serial Algorithm

The Serial MD algorithm written pseudo code looks somewhat like this:

#### Pseudo Code 
```python
initialize()
step = 0

while step < numSteps:

  for ( i = 1;  i <= nParticles; i++ ):
    for ( j = 1;  j <= nParticles; j++ ):
      if ( i != j ) :
        calculate_distance(i, j)
        calculate_potential_energy(i, j)
        # Attributing half of the total potential energy of this pair to particle J.

        calculate_force(i, j)
        # Add particle J's contribution to the force on particle I.

  calculate_kinetic_energy()
  update_velocities()
  update_coordinates()

finalize()
```
{: .code}

The algorithm basically works through a full matrix of size nParticles^2,
evaluating the distances, potential energies and forces for all pairs (i,j)
except for (i==j).

Graphically it looks like this:

#### Interaction Matrix: pair interactions (i!=j)
![full matrix pair interaction (i!=j)](../fig/planning/pairs_full_matrix.png)


### Optimized Serial Algorithm

We don't need to evaluate the pairs of particles twice for (i,j) and (j,i),
as the contribution to the potential energy for both is always the same,
as is the magnitude of the force for this interaction, just the direction
will always point towards the other particle.

We can basically speed up the algorithm by a factor of 2 just by eliminating
redundant pairs and only evaluating pairs (i<j) or vice versa.

#### Pseudo Code 
```python
initialize()
step = 0

while step < numSteps:

  for ( i = 1;  i <= nParticles; i++ ):
    for ( j = 1;  j <= nParticles; j++ ):
      if ( i < j ):
        calculate_distance(i, j)
        calculate_potential_energy(i, j)
        # Attributing the full potential energy of this pair to particle J.

        calculate_force(i, j)
        # Add the force if pair (I,J) to both particles.

  calculate_kinetic_energy()
  update_velocities()
  update_coordinates()

finalize()
```
{: .code}

### Simplistic parallelization of the outer FOR loop

A simplistic parallelization scheme would be to turn the outer for-loop
(over index i) into a parallel loop. How this can be done will be covered
on days two and three of the workshop.

The work could be distributed by assigning `i=1,2` to CPU&nbsp;1, `i=3,4` to 
CPU&nbsp;2, and so on. 

#### Pseudo Code
```python
initialize()
step = 0

while step < numSteps:

  # Run this Loop in Parallel:
  for ( i = 1;  i <= nParticles; i++ ):

    for ( j = 1;  j <= nParticles; j++ ):
      if ( i < j ):
        calculate_distance(i, j)
        calculate_potential_energy(i, j)
        # Attributing the full potential energy of this pair to particle J.

        calculate_force(i, j)
        # Add the force if pair (I,J) to both particles.
  gather_forces_and_potential_energies()

  # Continue in Serial:
  calculate_kinetic_energy()
  update_velocities()
  update_coordinates()
  communicate_new_coordinates_and_velocities()

finalize()
```
{: .code}

#### Interaction Matrix: with simplistic parallelization

> 
> With this parallelization scheme CPU cores are idle ~50% of the time.
{: .error}

With this scheme CPU&nbsp;1 will be responsible for many more interactions
as CPU&nbsp;8.  This can easily approved upon by creating a pair-list upfront
and evenly distributing particle-pairs for evaluation across the CPUs.


#### Pseudo Code: Using pair-list
```python
initialize()
step = 0

while step < numSteps:

  # generate pair-list
  pair_list = []
  for ( i = 1;  i <= nParticles; i++ ):
    for ( j = 1;  j <= nParticles; j++ ):
      if ( i < j ):
        pair_list.append( (i,j) )

  # Run this Loop in Parallel:
  for (i, j) in pair_list:
    calculate_distance(i, j)
    calculate_potential_energy(i, j)
    # Attributing the full potential energy of this pair to particle J.

    calculate_force(i, j)
    # Add the force if pair (I,J) to both particles.
  gather_forces_and_potential_energies()

  # Continue in Serial:
  calculate_kinetic_energy()
  update_velocities()
  update_coordinates()
  communicate_new_coordinates_and_velocities()

finalize()
```
{: .code}

### Using cut-offs

Still this MD algorithm scales with N<sup>2</sup><sub>particles</sub>.
Applying an appropriate cut-off radius r<sub>cut-off</sub>, beyond which all
forces and potential-energy contributions are truncated and treated as zero,
can restore near linear scaling.  One way to do this, is to bail out of
the loop over the pair-list after computing the distance if it is larger
than r<sub>cut-off</sub>.

Further optimizations can be made by avoiding to compute the distances for
all pairs at every step - essentially by keeping neighbor lists and using
the fact that particles travel only small distances during a certain number
of steps, however those are beyond the scope of this lesson and are well
described in text-books, journal publications and technical manuals.


### Spatial- (or Domain-) Decomposition

When simulating large numbers of particles (~ 10<sup>5</sup>)) and across many nodes, 
communicating the updated coordinates, forces, etc. every timestep can 
become a bottle-neck when using this Force- (or Particle-) Decomposition 
scheme, where particles are assigned to fixed processors as above.

To reduce the amount of communication between processors and nodes, we can
partition the simulation box along it's axes into smaller domains.
The particles are then assigned to the processors depending in which domain
they are currently located.  This way many pair-interactions will be local
within the same domain and therefore handled by the same processor.  For 
pairs of particles that are not located in the same domain, we can use e.g.
the "eighth shell" method in which a processor handles those pairs, in which 
the second particle is located only in positive direction of the dimensions,
as illustrated below.


#### Domain Decomposition using Eight-Shell method
![eighth shell domain decomposition](../fig/planning/domain_decomposition.png)

In this way each domain only needs to communicate with neighboring domains
in one direction as long as none of the domain's dimension shorter than the
longest cut-off.

## Load Distribution

Generally speaking the goal is to distribute the work across the available
resources (processors) as evenly as possible, as this will result in the 
shortest amount of time and avoids some resources being left unused.

An ideal load distribution might look like this:
#### Ideal Load: all tasks have same size
![Ideal Load](../fig/planning/ideal_load_distribution.png)

Whereas if the tasks that are distributed have varying length, the program
needs to wait for the slowest task to finish.  Such situations are even worse
in cases where a parallel execution is followed by a synchronization step,
before proceeding to the next iteration of a larger-scope loop (e.g. next 
time-step, generation, random-sample).
#### Unbalanced Load: size of tasks differs

#### Balanced Load: pairing long and short tasks

#### Larger Chunk-size evens out size of tasks

#### Smaller Chunk-size can sometimes behave better
